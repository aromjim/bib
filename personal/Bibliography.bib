	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are robust stochastic optimisers that perform well over a wide range
of problems. Their robustness, however, may be affected by several adjustable parameters, such as
mutation rate, crossover rate, and population size. Algorithm parameters are usually
problem-specific, and often have to be tuned not only to the problem but even the problem instance
at hand to achieve ideal performance. In addition, research has shown that different parameter
values may be optimal at different stages of the optimisation process. To address these issues,
researchers have shifted their focus to adaptive parameter control, in which parameter values are
adjusted during the optimisation process based on the performance of the algorithm. These methods
redefine parameter values repeatedly based on implicit or explicit rules that decide how to make
the best use of feedback from the optimisation algorithm.

In this survey, we systematically investigate the state of the art in adaptive parameter control.
The approaches are classified using a new conceptual model that subdivides the process of adapting
parameter values into four steps that are present explicitly or implicitly in all existing
approaches that tune param- eters dynamically during the optimisation process. The analysis reveals
the major focus areas of adaptive parameter control research as well as gaps and potential
directions for further development in this area.},

razonamiento. Aristóteles fue el primero en desarrollar una teoría de la argumentación deductiva,
por lo que se le considera con justicia el creador de la lógica como disciplina. La lógica
permaneció esencialmente en el mismo estado en que la dejó Aristóteles hasta mediados del siglo
xix, cuando inició un nuevo desarrollo, basado en gran medida en su capacidad para analizar con
ayuda de métodos matemáticos formas de razonamiento de las que la lógica aristotélica no podía dar
cuenta, en particular, aquellas en que intervienen expresiones cuantificacionales múltiples y
expresiones relacionales. Para el tratamiento sistemático de estas formas de razonamiento, se
desarrollaron a finales del siglo xix y principios del xx la teoría de las relaciones y la de la
cuantificación. Estas dos teorías, junto con el cálculo proposicional, cuyo estudio iniciaron los
lógicos megáricos y estoicos, constituyen el cuerpo básico de conocimientos de la lógica, una
disciplina que a lo largo del siglo xx se ha desarrollado considerablemente y que está todavía en
expansión. Elementos de lógica formal es un manual de introducción a la lógica, escrito
especialmente para estudiantes de filosofía, pero también para aquellas personas con formación
humanística interesadas en materias que requieran conocimientos lógicos. En él se exponen los
conceptos y resultados básicos de la lógica contemporánea sin presuponer ningún conocimiento
técnico especial por parte del lector. Los elementos de teoría de conjuntos necesarios para
presentar con rigor la lógica proposicional y, sobre todo, la cuantificacional se introducen de
forma pausada en los primeros capítulos del libro. El concepto de infinitud, que tradicionalmente
ha sido objeto de reflexión filosófica, es un concepto propio de la teoría de conjuntos que el
lector también encontrará caracterizado con rigor en estos capítulos.},

events may have different costs and benefits, which, when associated with the rarity of some of
them on the available training data, creates serious problems to predictive modeling techniques.
This article presents a survey of existing techniques for handling these important applications of
predictive analytics. Although most of the existing work addresses classification tasks (nominal
target variables), we also describe methods designed to handle similar problems within regression
tasks (numeric target variables). In this survey, we discuss the main challenges raised by
imbalanced domains, propose a definition of the problem, describe the main approaches to these
tasks, propose a taxonomy of the methods, summarize the conclusions of existing comparative studies
as well as some theoretical analyses of some methods, and refer to some related problems within

is a comprehensive treatment of inference for hidden Markov models, including both algorithms and
statistical theory. Topics range from filtering and smoothing of the hidden Markov chain to
parameter estimation, Bayesian methods and estimation of the number of states.

In a unified way the book covers both models with finite state spaces, which allow for exact
algorithms for filtering, estimation etc. and models with continuous state spaces (also called
state-space models) requiring approximate simulation-based algorithms that are also described in
detail. Simulation in hidden Markov models is addressed in five different chapters that cover both
Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo approaches. Many examples illustrate the
algorithms and theory. The book also carefully treats Gaussian linear state-space models and their
extensions and it contains a chapter on general Markov chain theory and probabilistic aspects of
hidden Markov models.

This volume will suit anybody with an interest in inference for stochastic processes, and it will
be useful for researchers and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing,
communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The algorithmic parts
of the book do not require an advanced mathematical background, while the more theoretical parts
require knowledge of probability theory at the measure-theoretical level.},

	abstract = {Written by John M. Chambers, the leading developer of the original S software,
__Extending R__ covers key concepts and techniques in R to support analysis and
research projects. It presents the core ideas of R, provides programming
guidance for projects of all scales, and introduces new, valuable techniques
that extend R.

The book first describes the fundamental characteristics and background of R,
giving readers a foundation for the remainder of the text. It next discusses
topics relevant to programming with R, including the apparatus that supports
extensions. The book then extends R’s data structures through object-oriented
programming, which is the key technique for coping with complexity. The book
also incorporates a new structure for interfaces applicable to a variety of
languages.

A reflection of what R is today, this guide explains how to design and organize
extensions to R by correctly using objects, functions, and interfaces. It
enables current and future users to add their own contributions and packages to
R.},

modern optimization methods, showing how such concepts and methods can be addressed using the open

particularly useful for solving complex problems for which no specialized optimization algorithm
has been developed. These methods often yield high quality solutions with a more reasonable use of
computational resources (e.g. memory and processing effort). Examples of popular modern methods
discussed in this book are: simulated annealing; tabu search; genetic algorithms; differential
evolution; and particle swarm optimization. This book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate

something silly. Likewise with data analysis, a small mistake in your model can

it is all too easy for a missed minus sign to generate a false prediction that
you don’t spot until it’s too late. Testing is the only way to be sure that

__Testing R Code__ teaches you how to perform development-time testing using
the testthat package, allowing you to ensure that your code works as intended.
The book also teaches run-time testing using the assertive package; enabling
your users to correctly run your code.

After beginning with an introduction to testing in R, the book explores more
advanced cases such as integrating tests into R packages; testing code that
accesses databases; testing C++ code with Rcpp; and testing graphics. Each
topic is explained with real-world examples, and has accompanying exercises for
readers to practise their skills — only a small amount of experience with R is

This paper proposes methods that can accelerate the learning of a Bayesian network structure from a
data set. These methods are applicable when learning an equivalence class of Bayesian network
structures whilst using a score and search strategy. They work by constraining the number of
validity tests that need to be done and by caching the results of validity tests. The results of
experiments show that the methods improve the performance of algorithms that search through the
space of equivalence classes multiple times and that operate on wide data sets. The experiments
were performed by sampling data from six standard Bayesian networks and running an ant colony
optimization algorithm designed to learn a Bayesian network equivalence class.},

Using a case-study-based approach for providing a comprehensive introduction to the principles of
object-oriented design, it includes:

* A sound footing on object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, interfaces, inheritance,

* A good introduction to the stage of requirements analysis
* Use of UML to document user requirements and design
* An extensive treatment of the design process
* Coverage of implementation issues
* Appropriate use of design and architectural patterns
* Introduction to the art and craft of refactoring
* Pointers to resources that further the reader's knowledge

The focus of the book is on implementation aspects, without which the learning is incomplete. This
is achieved through the use of case studies for introducing the various concepts of analysis and
design, ensuring that the theory is never separate from the implementation aspects.

All the main case studies used in this book have been implemented by the authors using Java. An
appendix on Java provides a useful short tutorial on the language.},

success of the overall API program. API documentation and the ease of developer
onboarding also determine the success of the APIs. Finally, monetization of
these APIs leads to revenue generation for the enterprise.

Author De — an expert in building and managing API solutions — provides
enterprise architects, designers, and technologists with insight into the world
of APIs and the various technical aspects of building and managing an effective
API management solution. _API Management: Developing and Managing APIs for your
Organization_:

* Introduces the basics of APIs and highlights their value
* Provides an overview of technologies for building an API management solution
  and defines the requirements, including how to build a RESTful API
* Offers design principles for building developer-friendly APIs
* Explains how to secure your APIs
* Shows how to use API analytics to measure the success of your APIs
* Demonstrates how to monetize APIs 

Finally, _API Management_ touches on various technical nuances of creating,

and every CPU cycle counts, and knowing how to squish every bit of processing power out of your

and sometimes the calculations done in those projects require some serious fine-tuning. Profilers
are tools designed to help you measure the performance of your code and help you during the
optimization process, so knowing how to use them and read their output is very handy.

This book starts from the basics and progressively moves on to more advanced topics. You’ll learn
everything from profiling all the way up to writing a real-life application and applying a full set
of tools designed to improve it in different ways. In the middle, you’ll stop to learn about the
major profilers used in Python and about some graphic tools to help you make sense of their output.
You’ll then move from generic optimization techniques onto Python-specific ones, going over the
main constructs of the language that will help you improve your speed without much of a change.
Finally, the book covers some number-crunching-specific libraries and how to use them properly to
get the best speed out of them.

After reading this book, you will know how to take any Python code, profile it, find out where the
bottlenecks are, and apply different techniques to remove them.

field's incredible richness, but without losing sight of the unifying principles. Peter Flach's
clear, example-based approach begins by discussing how a spam filter works, which gives an
immediate introduction to machine learning in action, with a minimum of technical fuss. Flach
provides case studies of increasing complexity and variety with well-chosen examples and
illustrations throughout. He covers a wide range of logical, geometric and statistical models and
state-of-the-art topics such as matrix factorisation and {ROC} analysis. Particular attention is
paid to the central role played by features. The use of established terminology is balanced with
the introduction of new and useful concepts, and summaries of relevant background material are
provided with pointers for revision if necessary. These features ensure Machine Learning will set a
new standard as an introductory textbook.},

	abstract = {Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple
Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features,
called naive Bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as
C4.5. This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less
restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we evaluate
approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning
Bayesian networks. These networks are factored representations of probability
distributions that generalize the naive Bayesian classifier and explicitly
represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a
method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes,
yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search
involved) and robustness that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentally
tested these approaches, using problems from the University of California at
Irvine repository, and compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper methods
for feature selection.},

Data__ presents an applied treatment of modern methods for the analysis of categorical data, both
discrete response data and frequency data. It explains how to use graphical methods for exploring
data, spotting unusual features, visualizing fitted models, and presenting results.

The book is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in the social and health
sciences, epidemiology, economics, business, statistics, and biostatistics as well as researchers,
methodologists, and consultants who can use the methods with their own data and analyses. Along
with describing the necessary statistical theory, the authors illustrate the practical application
of the techniques to a large number of substantive problems, including how to organize data,
conduct an analysis, produce informative graphs, and evaluate what the graphs reveal about the
data.

The first part of the book contains introductory material on graphical methods for discrete data,
basic R skills, and methods for fitting and visualizing one-way discrete distributions. The second
part focuses on simple, traditional nonparametric tests and exploratory methods for visualizing
patterns of association in two-way and larger frequency tables. The final part of the text
discusses model-based methods for the analysis of discrete data.},

first edition of the Handbook of Metaheuristics was published in 2003 under the editorship of Fred
Glover and Gary A. Kochenberger. Given the numerous developments observed in the field of
metaheuristics in recent years, it appeared that the time was ripe for a second edition of the
Handbook. When Glover and Kochenberger were unable to prepare this second edition, they suggested
that Michel Gendreau and Jean-Yves Potvin should take over the editorship, and so this important
new edition is now available. Through its 21 chapters, this second edition is designed to provide a
broad coverage of the concepts, implementations and applications in this important field of
optimization. Original contributors either revised or updated their work, or provided entirely new
chapters. The Handbook now includes updated chapters on the best known metaheuristics, including
simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighborhood search, scatter search and path relinking,
genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization, multi-start
methods, greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, guided local search, hyper-heuristics and
parallel metaheuristics. It also contains three new chapters on large neighborhood search,
artificial immune systems and hybrid metaheuristics. The last four chapters are devoted to more
general issues related to the field of metaheuristics, namely reactive search, stochastic search,
fitness landscape analysis and performance comparison.},

The six chapters in the second part of the book are on statistical computing. This part describes
arithmetic in digital computers and how the nature of digital computations affects algorithms used
in statistical methods. Building on the first chapters on numerical computations and algorithm
design, the following chapters cover the main areas of statistical numerical analysis, that is,
approximation of functions, numerical quadrature, numerical linear algebra, solution of nonlinear
equations, optimization, and random number generation.

The third and fourth parts of the book cover methods of computational statistics, including Monte
Carlo methods, randomization and cross validation, the bootstrap, probability density estimation,
and statistical learning.

	abstract = {This book is about visualization, systematically incorporating the fantastic human pattern
recognition into the problem-solving process, and focusing on parallel coordinates. The barrier,
imposed by our three-dimensional habitation and perceptual experience, has been breached by this
innovative and versatile methodology. The accurate visualization of multidimensional problems and
multivariate data unlocks insights into the role of dimensionality.

Beginning with an introductory chapter on geometry, the mathematical foundations are intuitively
developed, interlaced with applications to data mining, information visualization, computer vision,
geometric modeling, collision avoidance for air traffic and process-control. Many results appear
for the first time. Multidimensional lines, planes, proximities, surfaces and their properties are
unambiguously recognized (i.e. convexity viewed in any dimension) enabling powerful construction
algorithms (for intersections, interior-points, linear-programming).

Key features of Parallel Coordinates:
* An easy-to-read self-contained chapter on data mining and information visualization
* Numerous exercises with solutions, from basic to advanced topics, course projects and research
  directions
* "Fast Track" markers throughout provide a quick grasp of essential material.
* Extensive bibliography, index, and a chapter containing a collection of recent results (i.e.
  visualizing large networks, complex-valued functions and more)

Parallel Coordinates requires only an elementary knowledge of linear algebra. It is well-suited for
self-study and as a textbook (or companion) for courses on information visualization, data mining,
mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, finance, management, manufacturing, in
scientific disciplines and even the arts.},

and exercises, which also instruct the reader on how to build these models.

The book is a new edition of _Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs_ by _Finn V. Jensen_. The new
edition is structured into two parts. The first part focuses on probabilistic graphical models.
Compared with the previous book, the new edition also includes a thorough description of recent
extensions to the Bayesian network modeling language, advances in exact and approximate belief
updating algorithms, and methods for learning both the structure and the parameters of a Bayesian
network. The second part deals with decision graphs, and in addition to the frameworks described in
the previous edition, it also introduces Markov decision processes and partially ordered decision
problems. The authors also provide a well-founded practical introduction to Bayesian networks,
object-oriented Bayesian networks, decision trees, influence diagrams (and variants hereof), and
Markov decision processes.},

provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable
models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be
learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually
constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect
of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the
uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.

_Probabilistic Graphical Models_ discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks,
undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical
systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental
cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced
techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and
decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical
development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill
boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the
approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural
language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant

More and more of today’s numerical problems found in engineering and finance are solved through
Monte Carlo methods. The heightened popularity of these methods and their continuing development
makes it important for researchers to have a comprehensive understanding of the Monte Carlo
approach. Handbook of Monte Carlo Methods provides the theory, algorithms, and applications that
helps provide a thorough understanding of the emerging dynamics of this rapidly-growing field.

The authors begin with a discussion of fundamentals such as how to generate random numbers on a
computer. Subsequent chapters discuss key Monte Carlo topics and methods, including:

* Random variable and stochastic process generation
* Markov chain Monte Carlo, featuring key algorithms such as the Metropolis-Hastings method, the
  Gibbs sampler, and hit-and-run
* Discrete-event simulation
* Techniques for the statistical analysis of simulation data including the delta method,
  steady-state estimation, and kernel density estimation
* Variance reduction, including importance sampling, latin hypercube sampling, and conditional
  Monte Carlo
* Estimation of derivatives and sensitivity analysis
* Advanced topics including cross-entropy, rare events, kernel density estimation, quasi Monte
  Carlo, particle systems, and randomized optimization

The presented theoretical concepts are illustrated with worked examples that use MATLAB, a related
Web site houses the MATLAB code, allowing readers to work hands-on with the material and also
features the author's own lecture notes on Monte Carlo methods. Detailed appendices provide
background material on probability theory, stochastic processes, and mathematical statistics as
well as the key optimization concepts and techniques that are relevant to Monte Carlo simulation.

Handbook of Monte Carlo Methods is an excellent reference for applied statisticians and
practitioners working in the fields of engineering and finance who use or would like to learn how
to use Monte Carlo in their research. It is also a suitable supplement for courses on Monte Carlo
methods and computational statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels.},

of the book focuses on issues related to Monte Carlo methods—uniform and non-uniform random number
generation, variance reduction techniques—but the material is presented to prepare the readers for
the next step, which is to replace the random sampling inherent to Monte Carlo by quasi–random
sampling. The second part of the book deals with this next step. Several aspects of quasi-Monte
Carlo methods are covered, including constructions, randomizations, the use of {ANOVA}
decompositions, and the concept of effective dimension. The third part of the book is devoted to
applications in finance and more advanced statistical tools like Markov chain Monte Carlo and
sequential Monte Carlo, with a discussion of their quasi–Monte Carlo counterpart.

The prerequisites for reading this book are a basic knowledge of statistics and enough mathematical
maturity to follow through the various techniques used throughout the book. This text is aimed at
graduate students in statistics, management science, operations research, engineering, and applied
mathematics. It should also be useful to practitioners who want to learn more about Monte Carlo and

However, most MOEAs based on Pareto-dominance handle many-objective problems (MaOPs) poorly due to
a high proportion of incomparable and thus mutually nondominated solutions. Recently, a number of
many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been proposed to deal with this scalability
issue. In this article, a survey of MaOEAs is reported. According to the key ideas used, MaOEAs are
categorized into seven classes: relaxed dominance based, diversity-based, aggregation-based,
indicator-based, reference set based, preference-based, and dimensionality reduction approaches.
Several future research directions in this field are also discussed.},

a finite number of unordered values, with prediction error measured in terms of misclassification

pseudorandomness; Markov chains and phase transitions; and the outer reaches of quantum computing.
At every turn, they use a minimum of formalism, providing explanations that are both deep and

	title = {Dynamic Bayesian Networks: Representation, Inference and Learning},
	abstract = {Modelling sequential data is important in many areas of science and engineering. Hidden Markov
models (HMMs) and Kalman filter models (KFMs) are popular for this because they are simple and
flexible. For example, HMMs have been used for speech recognition and bio-sequence analysis, and
KFMs have been used for problems ranging from tracking planes and missiles to predicting the
economy. However, HMMs and KFMs are limited in their “expressive power”. Dynamic Bayesian Networks
(DBNs) generalize HMMs by allowing the state space to be represented in factored form, instead of
as a single discrete random variable. DBNs generalize KFMs by allowing arbitrary probability
distributions, not just (unimodal) linear-Gaussian. In this thesis, I will discuss how to represent
many different kinds of models as DBNs, how to perform exact and approximate inference in DBNs, and
how to learn DBN models from sequential data.

In particular, the main novel technical contributions of this thesis are as follows: a way of
representing Hierarchical HMMs as DBNs, which enables inference to be done in O(T) time instead of
O(T³), where T is the length of the sequence; an exact smoothing algorithm that takes O(logT) space
instead of O(T); a simple way of using the junction tree algorithm for online inference in DBNs;
new complexity bounds on exact online inference in DBNs; a new deterministic approximate inference
algorithm called factored frontier; an analysis of the relationship between the BK algorithm and
loopy belief propagation; a way of applying Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering to DBNs in
general, and the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem in particular; a way of
extending the structural EM algorithm to DBNs; and a variety of different applications of DBNs.
However, perhaps the main value of the thesis is its catholic presentation of the field of
sequential data modelling.},

nodes are the uncertain variables and whose edges are the causal or influential links between the
variables. Associated with each node is a set of conditional probability functions that model the
uncertain relationship between the node and its parents. The benefits of using BNs to model
uncertain domains are well known, especially since the recent breakthroughs in algorithms and tools
to implement them. However, there have been serious problems for practitioners trying to use BNs to
solve realistic problems. This is because, although the tools make it possible to _execute_
large-scale BNs efficiently, there have been no guidelines on _building_ BNs. Specifically,
practitioners face two significant barriers. The first barrier is that of specifying the graph
structure such that it is a sensible model of the types of reasoning being applied. The second
barrier is that of eliciting the conditional probability values. In this paper we concentrate on
this first problem. Our solution is based on the notion of generally applicable “building blocks”,
called _idioms_, which serve solution patterns. These can then in turn be combined into larger BNs,
using simple combination rules and by exploiting recent ideas on modular and object oriented BNs
(OOBNs). This approach, which has been implemented in a BN tool, can be applied in many problem
domains. We use examples to illustrate how it has been applied to build large-scale BNs for
predicting software safety. In the paper we review related research from the knowledge and software
engineering literature. This provides some context to the work and supports our argument that BN
knowledge engineers require the same types of processes, methods and strategies enjoyed by systems
and software engineers if they are to succeed in producing timely, quality and cost-effective BN
decision support solutions.},

power of the Python language. At the heart of this book lies the coverage of pandas, an open

Author Fabio Nelli expertly shows the strength of the Python programming language when applied to
processing, managing and retrieving information. Inside, you will see how intuitive and flexible it
is to discover and communicate meaningful patterns of data using Python scripts, reporting systems,
and data export. This book examines how to go about obtaining, processing, storing, managing and
analyzing data using the Python programming language.

You will use Python and other open source tools to wrangle data and tease out interesting and
important trends in that data that will allow you to predict future patterns. Whether you are
dealing with sales data, investment data (stocks, bonds, etc.), medical data, web page usage, or
any other type of data set, Python can be used to interpret, analyze, and glean information from a
pile of numbers and statistics.

This book is an invaluable reference with its examples of storing and accessing data in a database;
it walks you through the process of report generation; it provides three real world case studies or
examples that you can take with you for your everyday analysis needs.},

important in situations, such as modelling the safety of nuclear installations or assessing the
risk of terrorist attacks, where expert knowledge is essentially the only source of good
information. It also plays a major role in other contexts by augmenting scarce observational data,
through the use of Bayesian statistical methods. However, elicitation is not a simple task, and
practitioners need to be aware of a wide range of research findings in order to elicit expert
judgements accurately and reliably. _Uncertain Judgements_ introduces the area, before guiding the
reader through the study of appropriate elicitation methods, illustrated by a variety of
multi-disciplinary examples.

This is achieved by:

* Presenting a methodological framework for the elicitation of expert knowledge incorporating
  findings from both statistical and psychological research.
* Detailing techniques for the elicitation of a wide range of standard distributions, appropriate
  to the most common types of quantities.
* Providing a comprehensive review of the available literature and pointing to the best practice
  methods and future research needs.
* Using examples from many disciplines, including statistics, psychology, engineering and health
  sciences.
* Including an extensive glossary of statistical and psychological terms.

Ramalho takes you through Python’s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make
your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time.

Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages,
and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python
programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3.

This book covers:
* __Python data model__: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of
  objects
* __Data structures__: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes
  duality in the Unicode age
* __Functions as objects__: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this
  affects popular design patterns
* __Object-oriented idioms__: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces,
  operator overloading, and multiple inheritance
* __Control flow__: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the
  concurrent.futures and asyncio packages
* __Metaprogramming__: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and
  metaclasses work

use simulation to solve statistical problems. *Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R* covers the
main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R
implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and
comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the
theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and
Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here.

This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo
methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian
framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random
generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence
diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs algorithms,
and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R
package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but
no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as
statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance
and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.},

revised towards a coherent and flowing coverage of these simulation techniques, with incorporation
of the most recent developments in the field. In particular, the introductory coverage of random
variable generation has been totally revised, with many concepts being unified through a
fundamental theorem of simulation

There are five completely new chapters that cover Monte Carlo control, reversible jump, slice
sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, and perfect sampling. There is a more in-depth coverage of Gibbs
sampling, which is now contained in three consecutive chapters. The development of Gibbs sampling
starts with slice sampling and its connection with the fundamental theorem of simulation, and
builds up to two-stage Gibbs sampling and its theoretical properties. A third chapter covers the
multi-stage Gibbs sampler and its variety of applications. Lastly, chapters from the previous
edition have been revised towards easier access, with the examples getting more detailed coverage.

This textbook is intended for a second year graduate course, but will also be useful to someone who
either wants to apply simulation techniques for the resolution of practical problems or wishes to
grasp the fundamental principles behind those methods. The authors do not assume familiarity with
Monte Carlo techniques (such as random variable generation), with computer programming, or with any
Markov chain theory (the necessary concepts are developed in Chapter 6). A solutions manual, which
covers approximately 40\% of the problems, is available for instructors who require the book for a
course.},

expected to perform well on, and which should be left to traditional optimization methods. Second,
he teaches us to systematically design the "right" modern heuristic for a particular problem by
providing a coherent view on design elements and working principles. Third, he shows how we can
make use of problem-specific knowledge for the design of efficient and effective modern heuristics
that solve not only small toy problems but also perform well on large real-world problems.

Simple yet meaningful examples in R illustrate each step of the modeling process. The examples

The first three chapters explain the whole process of Bayesian network modeling, from structure
learning to parameter learning to inference. These chapters cover discrete Bayesian, Gaussian
Bayesian, and hybrid networks, including arbitrary random variables.

The book then gives a concise but rigorous treatment of the fundamentals of Bayesian networks and
offers an introduction to causal Bayesian networks. It also presents an overview of R and other
software packages appropriate for Bayesian networks. The final chapter evaluates two real-world
examples: a landmark causal protein signaling network paper and graphical modeling approaches for
predicting the composition of different body parts.

to objection recognition, scene analysis and associative memory. The studies of bio-inspired models
have important implications in computer vision and robotic navigation, as well as new efficient
algorithms for image analysis. Another significant feature of the book is that it begins with
fundamental dynamical problems in presenting the mathematical techniques extensively used in
analyzing neurodynamics, thus allowing non-mathematicians to develop and apply these analytical
techniques easily.

Written for a wide readership, engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians interested in

* superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources
  with automatically adjusted common scales
* add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear
  models, generalized additive models, and robust regression
* save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse
* create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be
  applied to multiple plots
* approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is
  represented on the final plot

This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and
attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a
mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in
the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your
problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page.},

you how to bundle reusable R functions, sample data, and documentation together by applying author
Hadley Wickham’s package development philosophy. In the process, you’ll work with devtools,
roxygen, and testthat, a set of R packages that automate common development tasks. Devtools
encapsulates best practices that Hadley has learned from years of working with this programming
language.

Ideal for developers, data scientists, and programmers with various backgrounds, this book starts
you with the basics and shows you how to improve your package writing over time. You’ll learn to
focus on what you want your package to do, rather than think about package structure.},

	abstract = {What exactly is data science? With this book, you’ll gain a clear understanding of this discipline
for discovering natural laws in the structure of data. Along the way, you’ll learn how to use the
versatile R programming language for data analysis.

Whenever you measure the same thing twice, you get two results—as long as you measure precisely
enough. This phenomenon creates uncertainty and opportunity. Author Garrett Grolemund, Master
Instructor at RStudio, shows you how data science can help you work with the uncertainty and
capture the opportunities. You’ll learn about:

* __Data Wrangling__—how to manipulate datasets to reveal new information
* __Data Visualization__—how to create graphs and other visualizations
* __Exploratory Data Analysis__—how to find evidence of relationships in your measurements
* __Modelling__—how to derive insights and predictions from your data
* __Inference__—how to avoid being fooled by data analyses that cannot provide foolproof results

Through the course of the book, you’ll also learn about the statistical worldview, a way of seeing
the world that permits understanding in the face of uncertainty, and simplicity in the face of
complexity.
